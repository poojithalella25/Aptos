# TokenWithBurnTax

## Project Title
**TokenWithBurnTax** - Deflationary Token Smart Contract on Aptos

## Project Description
TokenWithBurnTax is an innovative Move smart contract deployed on the Aptos blockchain that implements automatic token burning mechanisms on every transfer transaction. This deflationary approach permanently removes a configurable percentage of tokens from circulation during transfers, creating scarcity and potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens over time.

The contract features a simple yet effective burn tax system where each token transfer triggers an automatic burn of a predetermined percentage (configurable burn tax rate), making it an ideal solution for projects seeking to implement deflationary tokenomics without manual intervention.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize token economics on the Aptos blockchain by providing a seamless, automatic deflationary mechanism that:

- **Promotes Scarcity**: Continuously reduces token supply through organic transaction activity
- **Rewards Long-term Holders**: Benefits users who hold tokens rather than frequently trading
- **Ensures Transparency**: Provides clear tracking of burned tokens and remaining supply
- **Maintains Simplicity**: Offers an easy-to-use interface with minimal complexity
- **Supports Sustainability**: Creates a self-regulating economic model that adapts to usage patterns

We envision TokenWithBurnTax becoming the foundation for sustainable token ecosystems that naturally appreciate in value through usage, creating a positive feedback loop between utility and scarcity.

## Key Features

### üî• Automatic Token Burning
- **Configurable Burn Rate**: Set custom burn tax percentage (e.g., 2%, 5%, 10%)
- **Per-Transfer Burning**: Automatic token destruction on every transfer
- **Supply Reduction**: Permanent removal of tokens from circulation
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant reflection of burned amounts in total supply

### üìä Transparent Tracking
- **Burn History**: Complete record of all burned tokens
- **Supply Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of current vs original supply
- **Event Emission**: Blockchain events for all burn transactions
- **Analytics Ready**: Data structure optimized for analysis and reporting

### ‚ö° Gas Efficient Design
- **Lightweight Operations**: Minimal computational overhead per transfer
- **Optimized Storage**: Efficient data structures for cost-effective execution
- **Batch Processing**: Single transaction handles both transfer and burn
- **Move Language Benefits**: Leverages Aptos Move's safety and efficiency features

### üõ°Ô∏è Secure Implementation
- **Owner Controls**: Secure initialization and management functions
- **Built-in Safety**: Move language prevents common smart contract vulnerabilities
- **Transparent Logic**: Open-source, auditable burn mechanisms
- **Immutable Rules**: Burn tax rates set at initialization for predictability

## Future Scope
